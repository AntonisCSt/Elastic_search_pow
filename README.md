# Elastic_search_pow
Project for elastic search for the Project of the week


Day 1 (Date)

Understand the basics of Elasticsearch, including how it indexes and searches data. You can use some sample data (like JSON files) to get started.
Create a GitHub repository to store your Elasticsearch configuration files and any code you write.
Install Elasticsearch on your local machine or use a cloud-based instance. You can follow the [official installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html). (I would propose using Docker)
